# Game Development Portfolio (Łukasz Drobik)

## About Me  
Hi, I'm a Game Development student at Collegium Da Vinci, and this is my project portfolio.  
I'm an aspiring programmer, primarily working with Unity, though I've also created projects in Unreal Engine 5. I'm a fast learner, constantly improving my skills with each new project. Beyond academic assignments, I've participated in Game Jams, gaining hands-on experience in rapid prototyping and teamwork.  

## Projects

### Levels of Life  
- **Description**: Created during the 40-hour PogJam, where the theme was "level." The game represents life as a series of levels, each depicting a different stage of human existence—from infancy to old age and death. The gameplay consists of mini-games reflecting life's challenges at different ages.  
- **Tech**: Unity
